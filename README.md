0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL

Background Context
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!

HBNB_ENV: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
HBNB_MYSQL_USER: the username of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_PWD: the password of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST: the hostname of your MySQL
HBNB_MYSQL_DB: the database name of your MySQL
HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using FileStorage) or db (using DBStorage)

Tasks

0. Fork me if you can!
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

1. Bug free!
Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
All your unittests must pass without any errors at anytime in this project, with each storage engine!. Same for PEP8!

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ 
Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the skipIf feature of the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures. Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database”

For example, “you want to validate that the create State name="California" command in the console will add a new record in your table states in your database”, here steps for your unittest:

get the number of current records in the table states (my using a MySQLdb for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
execute the console command
get (again) the number of current records in the table states (same method, with MySQLdb)
if the difference is +1 => test passed

2. Console improvements
Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
Don’t forget to add tests for this new feature!

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with FileStorage engine.

3. MySQL setup development
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail

4. MySQL setup test
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail

5. Delete object
Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering

6. DBStorage - States and Cities
SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It’s time to change your storage engine and use SQLAlchemy

Update User: (models/user.py)

Add or replace in the class User:
class attribute places must represent a relationship with the class Place. If the User object is deleted, all linked Place objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Place object to his User should be named user
Update City: (models/city.py)

Add or replace in the class City:
class attribute places must represent a relationship with the class Place. If the City object is deleted, all linked Place objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Place object to his City should be named cities

9. DBStorage - Review

Update Place: (models/place.py)

for DBStorage: class attribute reviews must represent a relationship with the class Review. If the Place object is deleted, all linked Review objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a Review object to his Place should be named place
for FileStorage: getter attribute reviews that returns the list of Review instances with place_id equals to the current Place.id => It will be the FileStorage relationship between Place and Review

10. DBStorage - Amenity... and BOOM!
Update Amenity: (models/amenity.py)

Amenity inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Amenity:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, amenities
class attribute name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute place_amenities must represent a relationship Many-To-Many between the class Place and Amenity. Please see below more detail: place_amenity in the Place update
Update Place: (models/place.py)

Add an instance of SQLAlchemy Table called place_amenity for creating the relationship Many-To-Many between Place and Amenity:
table name place_amenity
metadata = Base.metadata
2 columns:
place_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of places.id, primary key in the table and never null
amenity_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of amenities.id, primary key in the table and never null
Update Place class:
for DBStorage: class attribute amenities must represent a relationship with the class Amenity but also as secondary to place_amenity with option viewonly=False (place_amenity has been define previously)
for FileStorage:
Getter attribute amenities that returns the list of Amenity instances based on the attribute amenity_ids that contains all Amenity.id linked to the Place
Setter attribute amenities that handles append method for adding an Amenity.id to the attribute amenity_ids. This method should accept only Amenity object, otherwise, do nothing.
